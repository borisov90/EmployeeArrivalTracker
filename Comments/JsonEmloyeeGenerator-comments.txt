JsonEmployee class should be in another file and should be a public class. 
Roles and Teams should either be Enums or KeyValues stored in the db.
Variables like "e" shouldn't exist. "employee" is much more meaningfull.
Instead of splitting every row like this ("e.Name = all_lines_in_file[i].Split('\t')[0];") we should split it once and add the values to a string array.
Employee Teams shouldn't be strings, but objects of type 'Team' instead.
Magic numbers should be avoided.
